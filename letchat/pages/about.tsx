                  <p>
                    Hi there! We're GitGud and we are a team of 6 bootcampers
                    from the The School of Code. We are currently building our
                    final project for the bootcamp and are excited to tell you a
                    bit more about it.
                    <br />
                  </p>

              <h3 className={style.textCenter}>Need for LetChat</h3>
              <p>
                During our market research we found that there seemed to be an
                overwhelming need, from both sides of the home letting process,
                for a platform that would allow tenants and landlords to connect
                and communicate more effectively. We also found that there was a
                strong desire for a way that would allow tenants and landlords
                to store important documents in one place, with quick and easy
                access if needed.
                <br />
                <br />
                This resulted in us deciding to build LetChat, a platform that
                would solve these problems whilst being wrapped in a user
                friendly and intuitive design.
                <br />
                <br />
                We are also looking to add additional features to our project in
                the future, such as a means of downloading transcripts and
                additional features bases on constant user feedback.

                <p>
                  It started with a very producitve ideation phase where we came
                  up with a list of features we wanted to include in our
                  project. We then broke those down further to ensure we could
                  complete the project in a realistic timeframe and this was
                  done using Miro and Figma.
                  <br />
                  We then went ahead and built the low and high fidelity
                  wireframes, component tree and database schema.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The following weeks, we commenced building the project using
                  Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Express, and Firebase.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Throughout development we used Trello and Github to ensure our
                  project was on track, we were able to communicate effectively
                  and ensuring our branches were up to date and protected.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We constantly came together to re-evaluate our user journeys
                  and improve the user experience all whilst making sure we were
                  on track to complete the project in time.
